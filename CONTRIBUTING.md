## Submitting a pull request

0. Fork and clone the repository
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature-name`
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to make sure you have the latest dependencies
1. Make your change
1. If available, run the unit tests and make sure they pass and have 100% coverage (`npm test`)
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
1. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged

Here are a few things you can do to increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- In your pull request description, provide as much detail as possible. This context helps the reviewer understand the motivation for and impact of the change.
- If there are unit tests, make sure they all pass. Pull requests with failing tests will not be merged.
