### Description

Birdseye is an interactive tool that dynamically displays GraphQL schemas. It helps teams visualize and understand the nodes and connections within their schema. Birdseye was built using jointJS and makes for a lightweight addition to any web project.

Try the React component on CodeSandbox: <br /><br />

### Features

1. Graphical view of any GraphQL schema
2. Ability to click on a field or type to view its connections
3. Dynamic zooming to focus on small portions of the schema at a time
4. Add to any web project
5. Customizable styling and theming

### Background

Birdseye was inspired by [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager) and the [Apis-guru](https://github.com/APIs-guru) team. We found that Voyager would add 1.2 MB to our projects, which was too big for us. This motivated us to create Birdseye, which has a bundle size of less than 200 KB. Birdseye is open source and free to use and explore.

### Getting Started

You can add birdseye to your project as either a Javascript library or as a React package. Get started by reading the docs for each method:

- [`graphql-birdseye-core` (Javascript library)](./packages/core/README.md)
- [`graphql-birdseye`(React Package)](./packages/react/README.md)

### Roadmap

We have plans to keep improving Birdseye. Here's what is next:

1. Improve performance for larger schemas
2. Option to toggle zoom navigation style
3. Smoother UI transitions and interactions
